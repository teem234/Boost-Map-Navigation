makefile included, requires CImg.h and c++ Boost Graphing Libraries

Using pathfinding algorithms to determine the path an AI would take to traverse a given map from given input
coordinates to given output coordinates. The paths taken are then drawn as overlays on an image.

This project uses an image jpg file and a map file in conjuction. The .map file contains characters that conform with
the coordinates on the jpg image of the map. Sections of the map including the purple, dark green, and blue are non traversable while
the other sections are.

This program converts the map file into a boost Graph, and each node knows which of the neighbors are able to be entered. 
After the graph is created inside the program, shortest path algorithms from given coordinates(such as dijkstras and AStar) are
run and their path is then drawn over the jpg image using the CImg library.
